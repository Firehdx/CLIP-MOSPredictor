# CLIP-MLP

## What's included in the file?
A report for the assignment, codes, pre-processed dataset (images and orignal data not included), models used in the report experiment, training and testing logs and figures.

## How to run the code?
First setup an environment with pytorch, clip and pycocoevalcap. You can find them in the requirement.txt. 

Then download dataset AGIQA-3K and AIGCIQA2023, you can place them together with the pre-processed data.

If you want to run the validate experiment, run clipscore.py. For training and predicting experiments, run MOSPredicter.py. (Don't mind the spelling mistake!)

Models and training-testing logs are included for validation. If you want so, write a validate file yourself.

And don't forget to change the path of dataset and models in .py files.

## For convenience, Just Read The Report!
